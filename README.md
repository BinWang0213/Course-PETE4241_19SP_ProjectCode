# PETE4241_19SP_ProjectCode

As a group, compare your Python codes for homeworks 1 – 4 with those of the other graduate students and figure out the sources of the differences. 

	* Fix any typos or bugs in your codes 
	* Extend your python code to be able to read in well logs from multiple wells and perform all the calculations in homeworks 1 through 3.
	* Compute all the components of the MEM for all the wells in the Volve field (as in Homeworks 1-3) 
	* Explore the given flow simulation data (CMG), and for each well in the reservoir simulation model, estimate the values of S1, S2, S3, UCS, E, ν, Pp, and ϕ against depth and at the depth interval (or resolution) of the well logs.
	* Also estimate the block or average values of S1, S2, S3, UCS, E, ν, Pp, and ϕ for each grid block through which the well passes.
	* Compare your estimated porosity and pore pressure values with the values in the reservoir simulation model.
