As a group, compare your Python codes for homeworks 1 ‚Äì 4 with those of the other graduate students and figure out the sources of the differences. 

### Q1. As a group, compare your Python codes for homeworks 1 ‚Äì 4 with those of the other graduate students and figure out the sources of the differences.

- [x] 1.1 Fix any typos or bugs in your codes
- [x] 1.2 Extend your python code to be able to read in well logs from multiple wells and perform all the calculations in homeworks 1 through 3.
- [x] 1.3 Compute all the components of the MEM for all the wells in the Volve field (as in Homeworks 1-3) 
- [x] 1.4 Explore the given flow simulation data (CMG), and for each well in the reservoir simulation model, estimate the values of S1, S2, S3, UCS, E, ŒΩ, Pp, and œï against depth and at the depth interval (or resolution) of the well logs.
- [x] 1.5 Also estimate the block or average values of S1, S2, S3, UCS, E, ŒΩ, Pp, and œï for each grid block through which the well passes.

</p>

- [x] 1.6 Compare your estimated porosity and pore pressure values with the values in the reservoir simulation model.

### Q2. Submit one Excel file with the following tabs:

- [x] 2.1 A tab with the following columns: X, Y and Z co-ordinates of the centroid of the cells in
each layer through which the well passes, as well as the corresponding values of S1, S2,
S3, UCS, E, and ùúà for this cell (computed in 1 v above).
- [x] 2.2 A second tab with the X, Y and Z co-ordinates of the centroid of all the cells in the CMG
simulation data file given.

### Q3. Using the CMG reservoir simulation model provided, perform reservoir simulation for Volve field.

- [ ] 3.1 Perform flow simulator using IMEX and compare your well production performance forecasts with those in the ‚ÄúVolve Sim model and
HM per jan-16‚Äù powerpoint slides uploaded under Topic 11.

- [ ] 3.2 Using the CMG IMEX documentation on Geomechanics and the example simulation data
files that comes with your CMG installation (typically in C:\Program
Files(x86)\CMG\IMEX\2017.10\TPL\gmc), modify the CMG_gmc.dat file in the Volve CMG
folder to perform a coupled geomechanics and flow simulation.

- [ ] 3.3 Compare your results from the coupled geomechanics and flow simulation with the
original results from the flow simulation only.
